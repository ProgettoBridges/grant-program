### Overview

- Progetto Bridges is a non-profit association based in Rome, dedicated to social and cultural promotion. Our mission is to serve as a bridge between businesses, institutions, individuals and key players in new technologies. We position ourselves as intermediaries to facilitate the dissemination and development of projects that involve the "traditional world", along with technologies and cultures related to blockchain, NFTs, phygital and WEB3.0. To embody this mission, we organized "RomaNFTWeek" event, which took place from September 14 to 17 2023, at the prestigious WeGil palace in Rome. During this event, we engaged artists, companies in the blockchain sector, and prominent figures in Italian Politics to discuss the future of these technologies. Notable participants included: Parliamentarian Andrea Casu, Riccardo Corbucci (Councillor and President of the Rome capital commission for statute and technological innovation), Brando Benifei (European Parliament member) and Fabrizio Ghera (Assessor of the Regione Lazio). Vechain was the main sponsor of the event.
- We choosed Vechain's blockchain not only for its performance, but also for its vision of the future and focus on sustainability.
- Our project involves developing solutions in various areas using using various Vechain tools (Wallets, Vorj, NFTs, Phygital etc).
